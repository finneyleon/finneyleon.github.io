    <h1> YOUTH BASEBALL</h1>
	<h2> Mt. Airy Baseball</h2>

	<P> When I am home for the summer I like to volunteer for Mt. Airy Baseball. I coach T-ball up through the senior level. My. Airy Baseball is geared toward inner city youth who may not otherwise have an opportunity to play. The cost to play is minimal and if you can’t afford it, you can still play. It’s a great opportunity for kids to be a part of a team and help each other work towards a goal. I feel like this is my way of paying it forward. Please check them out and support if you can. <A HREF="https://mtairybaseball.org">Mt.Airy Baseball</A> </P>
